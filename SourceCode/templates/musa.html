			<h2>Information</h2>
			<p>They wear light armor and use a sword as their primary weapon with a horn bow as their secondary weapon. Musa uses Stamina and WP. Mana pots will not regenerate your WP, but Herbal Juice will.</p>
      <p>
        The Musa class is a fast paced, dynamic, and fun class to play. Musa has more AoE skills with a lot more mobility and utility. Due to this they thrive in PvE. They are also quite strong in small scale PvP but their low defenses make them a little harder to master in large scale PvP. They rely heavily on their mobility and utility to survive a larger battle. New players must really keep in mind that there is quite a learning curve with any low defense class. However, just like any other class, they are very rewarding when you master them.

			<h2>Class Loadout</h2>
			<p>For your primary weapon, the  Liverto is without a doubt the best weapon you can get (besides Kzarka). You will want to upgrade it to +15 or higher as soon as possible. If you don’t have the budget for this weapon then the  Yuria weapon is what you should be using in the mean time while you save up enough silver for Liverto.</p>
      <p>The one of most popular armor choices for Berserker is the  Grunil set. It increases your maximum HP and will give you 2 socket slots on each piece, along with extra AP if you have the full set. Another advantage of using this set is that it is viable on any class, allowing you to swap to another class easily.</p>
			<p>The best armor in the game is currently dropped from Bosses.</p>
			 <li>Giath’s Helmet (helmet) – dropped from Giath.</li>
			 <li>Red Nose (chest) – dropped from the Red Nose and Contaminated Imp Captian.</li>
			 <li>Bheg’s Gloves (gloves) – dropped from Bheg.</li>
			 <li>Muskan’s Shoes (shoes) – dropped from Monastery Leader.</li>
			 <br>
			<p>These are the best accessories in the game. They do cost a significant amount of silver.</p>
			 <li>Fugitive Khalk’s Earring x2</li>
			 <li>Ring of Crescent Guardian x2</li>
			 <li>Ogre Ring Necklace x1</li>
			 <li>Basilisk’s Belt x1</li>
			<br>
			<p>If you don’t have enough silver for the best accessories, these are a good temporary alternative.</p>
			 <li>Bares Earring x2</li>
			 <li>Bares Ring x2</li>
			 <li>Topaz Necklace of Regeneration x1</li>
			 <li>Bares Belt (OR any with AP) x1</li>
