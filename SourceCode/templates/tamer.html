			<h2>Information</h2>
			<p>
        The Tamer class has one of the most unique play styles in Black Desert, along with the Berserker class. The Tamer class is fun to play and PvE is really easy because you have plenty of AoE skills. The combat style of Tamer is very fast paced with lots of mobility and low defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        At level 20 you are able to summon your pet “beast” who will aid you in combat. Once you reach level 49 another skill becomes available which allows you to ride your pet as a mount and attack whilst riding it. The Tamer class is quite dependent on their pet which makes large scale PvP quite challenging.

        For your primary weapon, the Liverto is what you should be aiming for before Kzarka. You will want to upgrade it to +15 or higher as soon as possible. If you don’t have the budget for this weapon then the Yuria weapon is what you should be using in the meantime while you save up enough silver for Liverto. You will want to enhance this to +15 as soon as possible as well and if you are having bad luck getting your Liverto you may want to make it ultimate (yellow) to close the AP difference between the two.
      </p>
			<p>
        For your off-hand, if you have a Yuria, Incense Trinket is best as you will need the accuracy for PvP and it has been proven to deal more damage than pure AP in PvE too. If you have Liverto or Kzarka as your main weapon, you will not need the accuracy and will want to switch to Needle Trinket.
      </p>
			<p>The best armor in the game is currently dropped from Bosses.</p>
			 <li>Giath’s Helmet (helmet) – dropped from Giath.</li>
			 <li>Red Nose (chest) – dropped from the Red Nose and Contaminated Imp Captian.</li>
			 <li>Bheg’s Gloves (gloves) – dropped from Bheg.</li>
			 <li>Muskan’s Shoes (shoes) – dropped from Monastery Leader.</li>
			 <br>
			<p>The most popular armour choice for Sorceress is the Grunil set. It increases your maximum HP and will give you 2 socket slots on each piece, along with extra AP if you have the full set. Another advantage of using this set is that it is viable on any class, allowing you to swap to another class easily.</p>
			<p>These are the best accessories in the game. They do cost a significant amount of silver.</p>
			 <li>Fugitive Khalk’s Earring x2</li>
			 <li>Ring of Crescent Guardian x2</li>
			 <li>Ogre Ring Necklace x1</li>
			 <li>Basilisk’s Belt x1</li>
			<br>
			<p>If you don’t have enough silver for the best accessories, these are a good temporary alternative.</p>
			 <li>Bares Earring x2</li>
			 <li>Bares Ring x2</li>
			 <li>Topaz Necklace of Regeneration x1</li>
			 <li>Bares Belt (OR any with AP) x1</li>
