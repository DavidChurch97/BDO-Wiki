			<h2>Information</h2>
			<p>The Dark Knight class uses a two-handed Kriegsmesser as their primary weapon and a Ornamental Knot as their secondary weapon (same offhand as Berserker). At level 56, the Dark Knight unlocks their awakening weapon. The Dark Knight class uses melee range to slash at their enemies as well as dark magical mid-ranged spells. She is often compared to the Sorceress class because of her dark magic and playstyle. They have quite a lot of mobility and powerful engages, as well as high attack damage once awakened. But they do have low defenses and can be somewhat of a glass cannon. Most of their skills do tend to feel quite slow as well and you should max your attack speed as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>This class is average in 1v1 situations because of their low defenses and if caught with CC they will probably die. However, the Dark Knight is strong in 5v5s and large scale PvP due to their AoE and high burst and are considered “OP” due to this. It is a strong class to play but some players also find the animations too slow and can find her play style boring. It’s really down to the person and you find that you either love the class or hate it.</p>

			<h2>Class Loadout</h2>
			<p>For your primary weapon, the  Liverto is without a doubt the best weapon you can get that isn’t bound. You will want to upgrade it to +15 or higher as soon as possible. If you don’t have the budget for this weapon then the  Yuria weapon is what you should be using in the mean time while you save up enough silver for Liverto.</p>
			<p>For your off-hand,  Krea or  Saiyer Ornamental Knot are good choices for Berserker.</p>
			<p>The best armor in the game is currently dropped from Bosses.</p>
			 <li>Giath’s Helmet (helmet) – dropped from Giath.</li>
			 <li>Red Nose (chest) – dropped from the Red Nose and Contaminated Imp Captian.</li>
			 <li>Bheg’s Gloves (gloves) – dropped from Bheg.</li>
			 <li>Muskan’s Shoes (shoes) – dropped from Monastery Leader.</li>
			 <br>
			<p>The one of most popular armor choices for Berserker is the  Grunil set. It increases your maximum HP and will give you 2 socket slots on each piece, along with extra AP if you have the full set. Another advantage of using this set is that it is viable on any class, allowing you to swap to another class easily.</p>
			<p>These are the best accessories in the game. They do cost a significant amount of silver.</p>
			 <li>Fugitive Khalk’s Earring x2</li>
			 <li>Ring of Crescent Guardian x2</li>
			 <li>Ogre Ring Necklace x1</li>
			 <li>Basilisk’s Belt x1</li>
			<br>
			<p>If you don’t have enough silver for the best accessories, these are a good temporary alternative.</p>
			 <li>Bares Earring x2</li>
			 <li>Bares Ring x2</li>
			 <li>Topaz Necklace of Regeneration x1</li>
			 <li>Bares Belt (OR any with AP) x1</li>
