			<h2>Information</h2>
			<p>
        Balenos is one of the smallest territories in the game, just north of Serendia and situated just south of the upper coastline. It is the beginning area of the game, with many weak monsters scattered throughout the countryside. Despite this there are some areas which have powerful enemies that could easily kill a new player. Being so close to the coast, its major settlement, Velia, is known as a fishing city with connections to the sea which make it an ideal place for beginner fishermen. Balenos is also very abundant in resources such as horses, wood and farming goods.
